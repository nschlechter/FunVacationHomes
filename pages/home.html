  Sunriver Resort is known for its close proximity to Mt. Bachelor and other ski resorts, as well as a seemingly endless supply of activities. The village also has many great restaurants and trinket shops to enjoy a relaxing vacation in a cute Central Oregon vacation hot spot. This 5 bedroom, 4 bath house is located on the 13th hole of the golf course, and just a five minute walk from the village mall!

<!-- Short blurb about Rockaway -->

  Located 10 miles outside of Tillamook, known for its amazing cheese and ice cream, is the small beach town of Rockaway. After enjoying a morning coffee at any one of the cute local coffee shops, you can browse through the many trinket shops, ice cream parlors, or the video arcade before heading back home to the private beach to challenge your friends at a game of sand volleyball. This oceanside home has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. After your long day of sand castles and kite flying, enjoy a nice cocktail while watching the sunset over the ocean from the deck or, even better, the hot tub!
