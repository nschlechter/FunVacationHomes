  Sunriver Resort is known for its close proximity to Mt. Bachelor and the Deschutes River, as well as a seemingly endless supply of resort activities. The village mall has many great restaurants and trinket shops to enjoy and is a 7 minute walk from the house.

<p style ="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 10%; text-align: left; text-indent: 30px"> I own and manage only 3 vacation homes. It is a pleasure to share my homes with others as they are all unique.  I designed and help build these homes in order to create an enjoyable vacation oasis in some of the most beautiful spots in Oregon. I have a quality rapport with my past guests and will work with you to make sure you enjoy your vacation!
